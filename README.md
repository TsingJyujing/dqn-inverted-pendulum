# Inverted Pendulum Controller

## Introduction

These elements are included in this project:

- Customized more flexible IP model
- A traditional pure PID model
- TODO DQN based controller
- TODO Others RL method IP controller
- MAYBE Fuzzy controller for IP and double-IP

## Reference

### Loss/Reward

$$ -R(t) = \theta(t)^2 + \alpha \times v(t) \times F(t) + \beta \times x(t)^2 $$


### Shortens
- IP: Inverted Pendulum
